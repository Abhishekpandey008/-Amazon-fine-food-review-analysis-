We performed the data pre-processing techniques on the sample data and then executed text processing for the review and summary.
After pre-processing, we perform exploratory data analysis and used several NLP techniques to featurize the data and
applied KNN, Na√Øve-Bayes,  Logistic regression, SVM, Decision Trees, 
Ensemble model such as Random forest, GBDT, Clustering algorithm, and Truncated SVD to 
predict whether the review will be positive or negative.
